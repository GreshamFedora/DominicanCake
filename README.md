Divine Dominican Cake

English-language site for client meant to serve as a means to display some of their work and to allow thos interested in the topic to contact them directly. Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

How It's Made:



Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


Built out relatively simple site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on client's needs and course corrected based on their input as the project was deveeloped. Primary goals of site were to display client's works, to inform about the product, and to allow means to contact the client for further information.

Lessons Learned:



The complications of getting images in a gallery where they are displayed alongside each other helped me to learn to be more sensitive to the needs of properly displayed said images in an aesthetically pleasing manner.
